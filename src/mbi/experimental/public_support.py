"""Experimental implementation of data synthesis using public data support.

This module provides an experimental function, `public_support`, which aims to
re-implement and generalize the technique presented in PMW^{Pub}
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08598.pdf). The core idea is to re-weight a public
dataset to match private marginal measurements, effectively generating synthetic
data that respects privacy constraints while leveraging public information.

Notable aspects and differences include:
- Adherence to the common interface for estimators within this repository.
- Support for unbounded differential privacy, including automatic total estimation.
- Flexibility to handle arbitrary measurements via `MarginalLossFn`.

Note: This implementation is experimental and not heavily optimized following
refactoring. Contributions for improvement are welcome.
