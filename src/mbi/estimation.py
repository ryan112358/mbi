"""Algorithms for estimating graphical models from marginal-based loss functions.

This module provides a flexible set of optimization algorithms, each sharing the
the same API.  The supported algorithms are:
1. Mirror Descent [our recommended algorithm]
2. L-BFGS (using back-belief propagation)
3. Regularized Dual Averaging
4. Interior Gradient
5. Universal accelerated mirror descent

Each algorithm can be given an initial set of potentials, or can automatically
intialize the potentials to zero for you.  Any CliqueVector of potentials that
support the cliques of the marginal-based loss function can be used here.

    This is a standard approach for fitting the parameters of a graphical model
    without noise (i.e., when you know the exact marginals).  In this case,
    the loss function with respect to theta is convex, and therefore this approach
    enjoys convergence guarantees.  With generic marginal loss functions that arise

        target_acc: target accuracy of the method. If `fun` is non-smooth, this
        needs to be set > 0. Convergence beyond that target accuracy is not
        guaranteed. If the function is smooth, set `target_acc=0`.
        stepsize: initial estimate of the stepsize.
        norm: type of norm measuring the smoothness of `fun`.
        linesearch: if true, uses linesearch to determine acceptance of step,
        otherwise use constant stepsize given by `stepsize`.

    Returns:
        (init_carry, cond_fun, body_fun) where
        init_carry: initial state of the step search.
        cond_fun: continuation criterion when searching for next step.
        body_fun: step when searching step.
